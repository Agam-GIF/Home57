        <p>Junk Food is a dream food for every child. As it may be unhealthy, still I like it but in limits. There are many types of Junk Foods. Personally it depends on taste buds as I don't like too sweet things or too bitter. You can't get a disease if you balance with healthy and junk food.</p>
